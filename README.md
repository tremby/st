This is a fork of [suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) with some patches applied.

None of the main patches are my own code;
see each patch's page for author information.

- [anysize](https://st.suckless.org/patches/anysize/)
- [scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/)
- [visualbell2](https://st.suckless.org/patches/visualbell2/) (enhanced version)

It also has my config header file checked in, which has a few basic changes:

- DejaVu Sans Mono font at 18 pixels
- "Tango dark" colour palette

Dependencies needed on Ubuntu to build:

    apt install build-essential libxft-dev

To render colour emoji without crashing,
libxft needs to be at at least version 2.3.5.
I installed Ubuntu 23.04's version (and the associated dev package)
on Ubuntu 22.04 and it seems to be happy.

Original readme follows:

---

st - simple terminal
====================
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
